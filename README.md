# eSpeedtest
[`speedtest.sh`] is a speedtest script to test your network bandwidth. If you are unable to run this script with ./speedtest.sh then you probably need to set it's permissions.

*You can do this by typing the following:*

```sh
chmod 755 speedtest.sh
```

after this has been done, you can type ./speedtest.sh to run the script.
