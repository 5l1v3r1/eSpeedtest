# eSpeedtest
[`espeedtest.sh`](https://github.com/hklcf/eSpeedtest/blob/master/espeedtest.sh) is a speedtest script to test your network bandwidth. If you are unable to run this script with `./speedtest.sh` then you probably need to set it's permissions.

*You can do this by typing the following:*

```sh
chmod 755 speedtest.sh
```

after this has been done, you can type `./speedtest.sh` to run the script.

# Requirement
This script tested on CentOS 7 and Debian 7 only.
